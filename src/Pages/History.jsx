                    <div>
                        <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Part 1: The Mittal Legacy Begins (1907 - 1951)</h4>
                        <p>In the year 1907, as India began its slow march toward independence, two visionary men, Ganga Ram Mohanlal Mittal and Shri Babulal Mittal, took a bold step that would lay the foundation for a lasting legacy. They launched India’s first brass rolling mill, a venture that not only symbolized economic resilience but also hope for a burgeoning nation. Their determination to build something from the ground up inspired generations, transforming a small family-run operation into what would eventually evolve into the renowned Mittal Group.</p>
                        <p className="mt-4">Over the decades, this enterprise flourished, becoming a beacon of hard work and dedication. The Mittal family, bound together by blood and purpose, toiled side by side, cultivating a culture of collaboration and shared dreams. By 1951, Suresh Chandra Mittal, one of the heirs, began to expand the business alongside his brothers, pouring their hearts into their work. Their efforts bore fruit as the Mittal name became synonymous with quality and trust across India, creating jobs and nurturing a sense of community.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Part 2: Family Splits and Economic Decline (1980s - 2003)</h4>
                        <p>As the Mittal empire grew, so did the complexities of familial relationships. The once-unified vision began to fray under the weight of ambition and differing perspectives. Tensions escalated among the brothers, leading to a painful division of the family business. Suresh Chandra Mittal took the helm of Malwa Metal Industries, dedicating his life to its growth, yet the shadow of competition and market shifts loomed large.</p>
                        <p className="mt-4">As the new century approached, the Mittal Group faced significant challenges. Poor financial decisions and internal strife created a perfect storm, leading to an unforeseen decline. By 2003, the once-thriving enterprise, valued at an impressive 1,000 crores, crumbled into bankruptcy within a mere thirty years. The collapse sent shockwaves through the family, shattering dreams and hopes, and leaving behind a legacy that felt more like a ghost than a triumph.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Part 3: A Family’s Struggle and Sarthak’s Early Years (2003 - 2011)</h4>
                        <p>In December 2003, amidst the ashes of their family’s financial ruin, Sarthak was born. The world he entered was one of uncertainty and despair, a far cry from the legacy of affluence his family once enjoyed. His father, Ashutosh Mittal, was engulfed in sorrow over the collapse of the family business, grappling with depression that cast a long shadow over their home. The family transitioned from a life of comfort to a modest existence, facing financial hardship and personal challenges that tested their resolve.</p>
                        <p className="mt-4">Yet, in the midst of turmoil, Sarthak’s mother emerged as a beacon of strength and resilience. Working tirelessly, she became the heart of the family, nurturing her children and instilling in them values of kindness, curiosity, and unwavering determination. Sarthak, though just a child, felt the weight of their struggles, yet he also experienced the warmth of his mother’s love, shaping his character and igniting a spark of hope in his young heart.</p>

                        <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Part 4: Loss, Family Tensions, and Sarthak’s Strength (2011)</h4>
                        <p>The year 2011 brought profound loss to Sarthak’s life. His beloved grandmother, a guiding presence who showered him with love and wisdom, succumbed to cancer. Her passing created an irreplaceable void, yet it also revealed the immense strength of his mother, who navigated the family through grief with grace and resilience. As tensions simmered with extended family members, Sarthak’s mother made the difficult decision to temporarily leave their family home, seeking peace and stability.</p>
                        <p className="mt-4">Suddenly, Sarthak found himself taking on new responsibilities. As a young child, he ran errands and helped his mother wherever he could, stepping up in ways that belied his age. This challenging period taught him valuable lessons about family loyalty, the importance of standing together in times of hardship, and the courage to face life’s challenges head-on. Through it all, he developed a strong sense of empathy and resilience that would guide him throughout his life.</p>

                        <p>In 2018, Sarthak Mittal<sup>™</sup> entered 10th grade at Choithram School North Campus in Indore, facing academic challenges and frustration with the CBSE curriculum's rigid, test-oriented structure. The pressure to perform and lack of creative freedom left him disillusioned.</p>
                        <p className="mt-4">Despite this, he achieved a respectable 81.25% in his final exams. Still, he grew increasingly weary of studying just for marks, feeling trapped in a system that limited his potential.</p>

                        <p>By 2019, Sarthak faced family expectations to pursue IIT like his relatives, even though he was uncertain about his path. Despite his reservations about mathematics, he enrolled in Prestige Public School, a "dummy" school, while preparing for the IIT entrance exam at FIITJEE Indore.</p>
                        <p className="mt-4">Isolated and overwhelmed, Sarthak found it challenging to handle the complexities of IIT-level questions and yearned for a different path. Feeling a pull toward other interests, he began exploring social media content creation.</p>

                        <p>Driven by curiosity, Sarthak launched his first YouTube channel, "Jokemon," experimenting with social media marketing by reposting content from platforms like TikTok. Although his family eventually discovered and shut down the channel to focus on his IIT preparations, he gained valuable insights into digital marketing.</p>
                        <p className="mt-4">Sarthak also saw an opportunity in his mother’s crafts, attempting to sell her handmade products on platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, facing initial setbacks before finding success on Meesho. This experience taught him about e-commerce, sparking a growing interest in business.</p>

Balancing IIT studies with caring for his family, Sarthak took on household responsibilities, including cooking and cleaning, while continuing his academic pursuits.</p>
                        <p className="mt-4">Although he contracted COVID-19 himself, a dedicated tutor motivated him to persevere, and he eventually completed 12th grade with a 74% aggregate.</p>

Here, he embraced coding and began exploring various entrepreneurial ideas, balancing academics with his drive to create impactful businesses.</p>
                        <p className="mt-4">He founded Mittal Alliance in 2020 to support MSMEs with AI solutions and rebranded his YouTube channel as "BAD Youth Media," eventually launching BadTalks, which connected industry professionals with students.</p>

He founded a C++ WhatsApp community, quickly growing it to over 1,000 members, which led to the creation of MentorMenti, a platform connecting students with mentors.</p>
                        <p className="mt-4">Although MentorMenti closed after eight months due to disagreements within the founding team, it taught Sarthak crucial lessons in team dynamics and startup management.</p>
